<p><strong>Mohcine Madkour, PhD</strong><br />
<strong>Senior Data Scientist | ML &amp; AI Engineering | Strategic Analytics Leadership</strong></p>

<p>A PhD-trained data scientist with over a decade of experience building high-impact, production-scale machine learning systems across healthcare, industrial IoT, and robotic surgery. I specialize in translating complex business challenges into scalable predictive frameworks—driving measurable improvements in operational efficiency, reliability, and ROI.</p>

<p>Currently at <strong>Intuitive Surgical</strong>, I design and deploy ML-driven service analytics for robotic platforms, increasing system uptime by 6.5% and boosting proactive maintenance capabilities by 97%. Previously at <strong>Cummins</strong>, I led warranty recovery and diagnostic optimization initiatives that delivered $7.2M+ in annual savings and improved engine reliability by 17%. My academic tenure at UF Health and UTHealth anchored my expertise in clinical AI, where I built predictive models for postoperative complications (AUC 0.82–0.94) and NLP-powered patient timelines.</p>

<p>I bring deep fluency across the full ML stack—from AutoGluon, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to MLOps on AWS/Azure—and hold certifications in Azure Data Science and Databricks Generative AI. Whether through anomaly detection, causal inference, or generative AI architecture, I focus on engineering intelligent systems that deliver clarity, foresight, and tangible business value.</p>
