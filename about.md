# About

**Mohcine Madkour, PhD**  
**Senior Data Scientist | ML & AI Engineering | Strategic Analytics Leadership**

A PhD-trained data scientist with over a decade of experience building high-impact, production-scale machine learning systems across healthcare, industrial IoT, and robotic surgery. I specialize in translating complex business challenges into scalable predictive frameworks—driving measurable improvements in operational efficiency, reliability, and ROI.

Currently at **Intuitive Surgical**, I design and deploy ML-driven service analytics for robotic platforms, increasing system uptime by 6.5% and boosting proactive maintenance capabilities by 97%. Previously at **Cummins**, I led warranty recovery and diagnostic optimization initiatives that delivered $7.2M+ in annual savings and improved engine reliability by 17%. My academic tenure at UF Health and UTHealth anchored my expertise in clinical AI, where I built predictive models for postoperative complications (AUC 0.82–0.94) and NLP-powered patient timelines.

I bring deep fluency across the full ML stack—from AutoGluon, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to MLOps on AWS/Azure—and hold certifications in Azure Data Science and Databricks Generative AI. Whether through anomaly detection, causal inference, or generative AI architecture, I focus on engineering intelligent systems that deliver clarity, foresight, and tangible business value.
